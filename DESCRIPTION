Description:  MLPACK is an intuitive, fast, scalable C++ machine learning
 library, meant to be a machine learning analog to LAPACK. 
OS_type: unix                                                                                       
SystemRequirements: A C++11 compiler. Version 4.6.* of g++ (as currently in                         
 Rtools) is insufficient; versions 4.8.*, 4.9.* or later will be fine.
