RcppMLPACK
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thirdwing/RcppMLPACK.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thirdwing/RcppMLPACK)

[MLPACK](http://www.mlpack.org/) is a C++ machine learning library with emphasis on scalability, speed, and ease-of-use. Its aim is to make machine learning possible for novice users by means of a simple, consistent API, while simultaneously exploiting C++ language features to provide maximum performance and maximum flexibility for expert users. MLPACK outperforms competing machine learning libraries by large margins; see the [BigLearning workshop paper](http://www.mlpack.org/mlpack_biglearn.pdf) for details. 

The RcppMLPACK package includes the header files from the MLPACK library. Thus users do not need to install MLPACK itself in
order to use RcppMLPACK. 
 
This MLPACL integration heavily relies on [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org) package for seamless R and C++ integration.
